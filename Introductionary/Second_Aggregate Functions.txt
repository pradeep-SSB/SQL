Aggregate Functions- perform some calculation on the data in a database.

SELECT AVG(budget)
FROM films;
SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films;
SELECT MAX(gross)
FROM films
WHERE  release_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2012;
MIN, SUM..

2. Arithmetic- In addition to using aggregate functions, you can perform basic arithmetic with symbols like +, -, *, and /.
SELECT (4 / 3);  --> 1 ( SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer(matters divident), you want to get an integer back. So be careful when dividing! )
SELECT (4.0 / 3.0) ;--> 1.333
SELECT title, gross - budget AS net_profit
FROM films;

3. Aliasing- Aliases are helpful for making results more readable! ( Aliases are helpful for making results more readable! )
SELECT MAX(budget), MAX(duration)
FROM films;
SELECT MAX(budget) AS max_budget,
       MAX(duration) AS max_duration
FROM films;
SELECT ( COUNT(deathdate) * 100.0/COUNT(*) ) AS percentage_dead
FROM people;
