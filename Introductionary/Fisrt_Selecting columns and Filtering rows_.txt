Sql [First + Second]

1.Sql: Not case sensitive, but good practice to use keywords as BLOCKS--   
SELECT *
FROM films;

select country
from films;

2. DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM films;

3. COUNT
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people;

SELECT COUNT(birthdate)
FROM people;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ( birthdate) )
FROM people;

WHERE
4. Notice that the WHERE clause always comes after the FROM statement!
5. Note that in this course we will use <> and not != for the not equal operator, as per the SQL standard.\
6.The WHERE clause can also be used to filter text results, such as names or countries
7. Important: in PostgreSQL (the version of SQL we're using), you must use single quotes with
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'French';

8.WHERE AND- Often, you'll want to select data based on multiple conditions. You can build up your WHERE queries by combining multiple conditions with the AND keyword.
9. WHERE AND OR- If you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not all of the conditions need to be met
10. When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so: Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');

11. BETWEEN- you can use the following query to get titles of all films released in and between 1994 and 2000(Inclusive):
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';

12. WHERE IN-  works as OR operator
SELECT title, certification
FROM films
WHERE 	certification IN ('NC-17' , 'R');

13. NULL, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM films
WHERE language IS NULL;

14. LIKE and NOT LIKE-  In the real world, often you'll want to search for a pattern rather than a specific text string.
SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE name LIKE 'B%';
SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE name LIKE '_r%';

SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'A%'
